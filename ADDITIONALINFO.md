# Approach
The approach used was Using 2 LLMs to compare the accuracy and there results with each other. additionally displays the similarity between each LMM with the word. All the data is stored in a database and can be used and vied as a summary.

# Limitations
1. Requirments of imports done manual by the user

2. Having to manually type or copy and paste file locations

3. Only being able to alter a CSV file once before restarting program

4. To simple and hard to understand rows and columns

5. To much data held in a single cells

# Suggestions
1. Add file explorer 

2. Clean up spreadsheet

3. Use Chromadb

4. use tkinter (UI/UX design)

5. allow the option to create a CSV file not just append to one

# Additional notes
I beleive this can be scalable due to how it was organized and made, the suggestions made can be easily added and scaled to more complex operations, such as the storage of the data, using file explorer, and with the classes.

Due to the time of 3 days and my skill level, there is a "bug" it seems, displays an error when embedding each word. However, I do not see it affected the results based on my knowing, more time could be used to fix these many problems.
