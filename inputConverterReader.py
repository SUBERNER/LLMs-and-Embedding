#inputConverterReader

#Asks user to select a file
#Program takes the data and gives it to other program files to format and convert it correctly
#Finally, it will be send and stored inside a CSV file


#allow user to pick between selecting a file or typeing text directly
    #"How would you like to send your text data?"
    #"press [1] for file input"
    #"press [2] for typing input"
    
#if user give invalid input, repeat question

#if user selects file input
    #file exploer is opened and user selects a file to use

#if user selects typing input
    #program asks user to type the text they want to be processed. Once done the user presses enter
    #after that the text file is sent to be used
    
    
#Text data from either one is then stored inside of a variable to temperarily hold it until converted correctly

#lists are then created, one sotring the literal string format of the word
#the other list holds the converted embedded version of the text

#use a foreach loop and convert each word into a embedded version
#the loop should then add the converted text into the second list

#the embeded list and the literal string lisr should both be simmeterical
#if the first value is apple in one list, the other list's first value sould be the embedded text of apple

#additionally, use another database to compare the accuracty of the emmbedding used by this program

#then the list is in another foreach loop
#with each word and corresponding embedding being added in a row in the CVS file
